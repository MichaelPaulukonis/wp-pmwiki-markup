Using the combination of a cookbook recipe for [PmWiki](http://www.pmwiki.org) (that provides pmwiki-markup-to-html as a service) and a [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) plugin, you can write WordPress posts that avoid both raw-HTML and the visual editor, while taking advantage of your PmWiki's Intermap, and other capabilities.
