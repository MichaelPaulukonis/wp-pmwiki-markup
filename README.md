Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/wp-pmwiki-markup

Using the combination of a cookbook recipe for [PmWiki](http://www.pmwiki.org) (that provides pmwiki-markup-to-html as a service) and a WordPress plugin, you can write WordPress posts that avoid both raw-HTML and the visual editor, while taking advantage of your PmWiki's Intermap, and other capabilities.

# Roadmap

    Better CSS
    Integrate into Wordpress admin panel
    expose options (currently several things are hard-coded as "off")
        TODO: document what these are! 

    error-handling
    verify pmwiki-url from admin panel 

    Look into retrieving some CSS from pmwiki
    Look into retrieving some javascript from pmwiki 

    install a local copy of pmwiki?
        this is actually done by the fswiki plugin.
        for fswiki, this is a laaaaaarge payload
